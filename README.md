This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

This project has been customized into a vibrant retro diner style landing page for the Fry Guys cloud kitchen brand.

### Features

- Neon animated headline & diner color palette (red / yellow / teal)

- Retro receipt-style newsletter signup form
- Interactive emoji icon row (fries, burger, soda, milkshake)
- Falling fries particle animation when clicking the fries icon
- Milkshake wobble animation on hover
- Hidden Secret Menu easter egg
- Responsive & accessible (ARIA labels, prefers-reduced-motion support)

### Easter Eggs

| Action | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
| Type `secret menu` | Opens secret modal with a fictional item (McPuff 2.0) |
| Click any üçü fries icon | Launches a burst of falling fries |
| Hover ü•õ milkshake | Shakes the glass |

### Customization

Update the placeholder launch date inside `app/page.js`:

```js
const LAUNCH_DATE = new Date("2025-12-31T18:30:00.000Z");
```

Change colors / intensity in `app/globals.css` (search for `--diner-`).
